# Quick Start Guide

Get your music and events platform up and running in minutes. No coding required — everything is done through the admin dashboard.

---

## Step 1: Open Your Site

Once the app is running, you'll see the landing page with placeholder content. Everything you see — text, images, fonts, colours — can be customised from the admin dashboard.

---

## Step 2: Open the Admin Dashboard

1. Tap the **hamburger menu** (three lines) in the top-right corner
2. Select **Admin**
3. You'll see the dashboard with 13 sections along the top

---

## Step 3: Set Up Your Branding

### Global Branding (Section 1)
- Enter your **company or event name** — this appears in the top ribbon on every page
- Upload your **logo** — it replaces the placeholder in the header bar

### Style Guide (Section 2)
- Set your **primary colour**, heading colour, and background colour
- Choose **heading and body fonts** from the dropdown
- Upload a **custom font** (.ttf, .otf, .woff, .woff2) if you have one — it will automatically become available in the font dropdowns

---

## Step 4: Add Your Content

### Landing Page (Section 7)
- Set the **heading text** that appears at the top of the home page
- Customise the **search placeholder** text
- Set the **enquiry form title**
- Upload a **banner image** for the bottom of the page

### Wallpapers (Section 3)
- Upload **background images** for any page: Home, Artists, Events, DS, and Login
- Each wallpaper gets a semi-transparent overlay so your text stays readable

### Social Media (Section 4)
- Paste your links for **Instagram, Facebook, X, TikTok, YouTube, SoundCloud, Spotify, Bandcamp, your website, and email**
- Only platforms with URLs filled in will show up on the landing page

### Animations (Section 5)
- Set up to **3 animation boxes** that appear on the landing page
- For each box, enter **text**, choose an **animation style** (fade-in, slide-up, slide-left, slide-right, zoom-in, bounce, or pulse), and optionally upload a **background image**

## Step 5: Add Artists

### Manage Artists (Section 8)
1. Click **Add Artist**
2. Fill in the name and any other details — genre, description, bio, origin, members, links, images
3. Use the **eye icons** next to each field to show/hide that field on the public page
4. Click **Save** when done
5. To feature an artist on the home page grid, check the **Featured** toggle

### Bulk Import
- Click the **CSV Import** card to upload a spreadsheet of artists
- Download a **CSV Export** first to see the expected column format

---

## Step 6: Add Events

### Manage Events (Section 9)
1. Click **Add Event**
2. Fill in the name, date, time, venue, address, description, and ticket URL
3. Add a **Google Maps URL** to embed a map on the event detail page
4. Use **eye icons** to control which fields are visible
5. Click **Save**

---

## Step 7: Set Up DS Client Profiles

### DS Page (Section 12)
- Set the **page title** and **content text** for the DS page
- Upload a **content image**
- Add **client profiles** with the same rich fields as artists (images, bio, contact, links, members, visibility toggles)

---

## Step 8: Add Media

Go to **Integrations** (from the hamburger menu) and scroll to the **Media Manager** at the bottom.

1. Enter a **title** and **URL** for your media
2. Choose the **type**: YouTube, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, or Audio
3. Click **Add**
4. Media items appear in the player on the landing page

**Supported media:**
- YouTube video URLs
- Bandcamp embed URLs
- SoundCloud track URLs
- Direct audio file URLs

---

## Step 9: Configure Navigation

### Navigation (Section 13)
- Rename the **bottom nav buttons** (Home, Artists, Events, DS, Profile)
- Toggle which items appear in the **hamburger menu** (including Donate, Admin, and Integrations)

---

## Step 10: Set Up the Login Page

### Login Page (Section 6)
- Set the **welcome text** and **subtitle**
- Upload a **header image** for the login page

---

## Step 11: Enable Integrations (Optional)

Go to **Integrations** from the hamburger menu.

### Google Sheets
- Toggle Google Sheets on
- Enter your **Sheet ID** and **sheet name** for enquiries and/or donations
- Form submissions will automatically be logged to your spreadsheet

### AI Assistant
- Toggle on and enter your **API key** (OpenAI or Anthropic)
- Choose your **model** and **provider**

### Donations
- Toggle donations on
- Set the **title**, **description**, and **suggested amounts**
- The Donate page will become available from the hamburger menu

### Other Integrations
- Toggle cards for Google Drive, Docs, Gmail, YouTube, YouTube Music, Bandcamp, DistroKid, and Stripe (Stripe is dormant — ready for future activation)

---

## Step 12: Set Up Donations (Optional)

1. Go to **Integrations** and enable **Donations**
2. Set a **title**, **description**, and comma-separated **amounts** (e.g. "5,10,25,50,100")
3. The **/donate** page will display a form where visitors can choose an amount and submit
4. Optionally connect a **Google Sheet** to log donations automatically

---

## Tips

- **Changes save per section** — click Save within each admin section, and changes appear immediately on the public pages
- **Visibility toggles** (eye icons) let you show/hide individual fields on artist, event, and DS client profiles without deleting the data
- **Everything is a placeholder** by default — dashed boxes show where images will go, and bracket text like `[ Company Name ]` shows where your content will appear
- **Mobile-first** — the layout is designed for phones but works on desktop too
- **Share buttons** appear on the landing page, artist detail, and event detail pages

---

## Need Help?

The admin dashboard is designed to be self-explanatory. Each section focuses on one part of the site. Work through them in order (1 through 13) for the best setup experience.
